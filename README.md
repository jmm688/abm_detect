This repository also contains many plotting helper functions to easily map out pixels to corresponding geographic locations and will export various Gtiffs.

UPDATE!!! abm_detect now supports various Tensorflow CNN models, including code for preprocessing images! woohoo! image classification is super rad!

UPDATE!!! repository now contains various json scripts for processing LiDAR point cloud.laz files using PDAL!
